# Curry MVC

This is a MVC website that I had built for one of my classes. Currently it is not properly connecting to the Azure SQL database. But it can be run on a local machine. It requires users to login or Oauth with google, and then they can upload curry recipe information. <br>

This is a MVC application using the .Net Framework.

This is a website that looks at curry.
